# Bitcoin and Ethereum Trading Algorithm

## Premise
---
Our goal is to build a machine learning trading algorithm for Bitcoin and Ethereum that consists of four different trading strategies that investors could potentially take advantage of. 

*Steps:*
---
 1. Gather data(alpaca API paper trading)
 2. Prepare the data(OHLCV format and any other data we will need in order to use strategy>
 3. Split the data(Split between training and testing data, will train model with pricing data from offset months)
 4. Once data is preprocessed we will keep the original data in one file, then create a folder that contains 4 separate strategies.
  
*Strategies:*
---
 1. Casey's Strategy 
 2. Spencer's Strategy 
 3. Dickie's Strategy
 4. Becca's Strategy
 
 ***Analyze the data, draw conclusions on each strategy.***
  
  *Models:*
  1. 
  
  
### Create powerpoint to demonstrate investment strategies to investors
-Mention how our trading algorithm is a stepping stone that can be easily built on when companies decide to further advancve their results.
-Also, if investors are ready to take the leap of faith all they would need to do list put in their keys to a live trading alpaca account.
